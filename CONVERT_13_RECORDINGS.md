## EASIEST METHOD: Use Online Converter

### Go to: https://cloudconvert.com/mov-to-gif

**For each of your 13 files:**

1. **Upload** the .mov file
2. **Settings:**
   - Width: 400px
   - Quality: 80%
   - FPS: 10
3. **Click "Start Conversion"**
4. **Download** the .gif

## OR: Quick Terminal Method

If you want to use the script I created:

```bash
# 1. Install ffmpeg (one-time):
brew install ffmpeg

# 2. Run the conversion script:
cd "/Users/dsaksena/Desktop/GenAI/Cursor/Wellness Assistance"
./convert-videos-to-gifs.sh
```

This will automatically convert all 13 videos!

## AFTER CONVERSION:

Once all 13 GIF files are in the `demos/` folder, tell me and I'll:
- ✅ Update README.md with all GIFs
- ✅ Add proper sections and descriptions
- ✅ Commit everything to Git

**Which method do you want to use?**

1. Online converter (ezgif.com or cloudconvert.com) - No installation needed
2. Automatic script - Requires `brew install ffmpeg` first

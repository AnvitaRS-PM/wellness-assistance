## OpenAI Integration

The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate personalized diet recommendations based on:
- User health metrics (weight, height, BMI goals)
- Health conditions (PCOS, diabetes, thyroid, etc.)
- Dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, etc.)
- Food preferences and allergies
- Timeline to achieve goals

The AI provides:
- Recommended diet type (LCHF, Mediterranean, etc.)
- Meal frequency and timing
- Meal schedule suggestions
- Recommended foods for healing
- Foods to avoid
- Rationale for the recommendations

## Development Notes

### Current Features
- ✅ Complete UI for all 5 screens
- ✅ Navigation between screens
- ✅ User data collection and state management
- ✅ OpenAI API integration for diet recommendations
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Actual authentication implementation (Firebase/Auth0)
- [ ] Database integration for saving user profiles
- [ ] Meal planning screen with calendar
- [ ] Food logging and nutrition tracking
- [ ] Recipe recommendations
- [ ] Progress tracking and analytics
- [ ] Push notifications for meal reminders

## API Key Security

⚠️ **Important**: The OpenAI API key is currently hardcoded in `src/config/config.js` for development purposes. For production:

1. Use environment variables
2. Store API key securely on backend
3. Make API calls through your backend server
4. Never commit API keys to version control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Expo not starting**: 
   - Clear cache: `expo start -c`
   
2. **OpenAI API errors**:
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure API key has sufficient credits

3. **Navigation errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Try: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
